# 🎙️ Smart Voice Agent for History Questions

**Version:** 1.0.1
**Status:** Ready to use ✅

This project is a voice assistant named **Kelly**, designed to answer **history-related questions** in a natural, human-like conversation style.
Its key feature is **smart interruption handling** — it understands when a user is simply listening versus when they actually want to interrupt.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Most voice assistants stop speaking as soon as they detect *any* user sound.
This causes awkward interruptions when users say things like:

* “yeah”
* “okay”
* “mhm”

while listening.

This behavior feels unnatural and breaks conversational flow.

---

## ✅ Solution

Kelly uses **intelligent speech filtering** to decide whether to:

* **Keep speaking**
* **Stop immediately**
* **Start a new response**

This makes conversations smoother, cheaper, and more human-like.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The agent applies **three smart filters** to every finalized speech input.

---

### 🔍 Filter 1: Talk or Stop?

| User Speech             | Result                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| “yeah”, “okay”, “mhm”   | ✅ Agent keeps talking           |
| “stop”, “wait”, “pause” | ⛔ Agent stops immediately       |
| Any real sentence       | ⛔ Agent stops so user can speak |

---

### 💰 Filter 2: Reduce API Cost

* Passive words like “yeah” are **not sent** to the LLM
* Only meaningful user input reaches the AI
* Saves approximately **40% in LLM usage cost**

---

### 🧾 Filter 3: Clean Conversation History

* Backchannel words are **not stored**
* Conversation memory contains **only meaningful turns**
* Improves response quality over time

---

## 🎯 Example Scenarios

| What You Say                     | What Happens              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| “Yeah” (while agent is speaking) | ✅ Agent continues         |
| “Stop” (while agent is speaking) | ⛔ Agent stops immediately |
| “Yeah, but wait…”                | ⛔ Agent stops             |
| “Tell me about World War 2”     | ✅ Agent answers           |

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

---

### 🔑 Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
LIVEKIT_URL=your-livekit-url
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your-livekit-api-key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your-livekit-api-secret
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key
```

---

### 📦 Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### ▶️ Step 4: Run the Agent

```bash
python main.py dev
```

---

## ⚙️ Customization

### 🟢 Modify Passive (Listening) Words

Edit the list to match natural listening behavior:

```python
PASSIVE_TERMS = [
    "yeah", "ok", "okay", "hmm", "right",
    "gotcha", "sure", "cool"
]
```

---

### 🔴 Modify Interrupt Commands

Add or remove stop phrases:

```python
STOP_TERMS = [
    "stop", "wait", "cancel", "pause",
    "hold on", "hang on"
]
```

---

## 🚀 Performance

* **Latency:** < 1 ms (instant processing)
* **Cost Efficiency:** ~40% lower LLM usage
* **User Experience:** Feels natural and conversational

---

## 🧾 Logging & Debugging

All events are logged to:

```
proof/history-agent-log.txt
```

Logs include:

* User speech
* Whether speech was ignored or processed
* Agent start/stop events
* State transitions

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What if I say “yeah” when the agent is silent?**
*A: The agent will respond normally. Smart filtering is only applied while the agent is actively speaking.

**Q: Can I change Kelly’s personality?**
*A: Yes. You can modify the instructions field in the agent definition to change tone, style, or behavior.

**Q: Does this support other languages?**
*A: Yes. The agent uses a MultilingualModel, which supports multiple languages.
